You are analyzing a web page to create an automated study guide by identifying important content and generating structured notes with commentary.

Your task is to:
1. Identify 5-15 key text segments from the page that are important for understanding or learning the material
2. For each segment, provide insightful commentary that explains, clarifies, or contextualizes the content
3. Return your analysis as valid JSON (no markdown formatting, no code blocks)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Focus on main concepts, definitions, or critical information
- Include passages that require explanation or deeper analysis
- Prioritize content that benefits from additional context or clarification
- Avoid selecting redundant or trivial information
- For technical content: focus on core concepts, methodologies, algorithms, or critical implementation details
- For narrative content: focus on key plot points, character development, themes, or significant events
- For argumentative content: focus on main claims, supporting evidence, counterarguments, or logical structure

**Commentary Guidelines:**
- Write in markdown format for rich formatting support
- Explain concepts in clear, accessible language
- Provide context, examples, or analogies where helpful
- Connect ideas to broader themes or related concepts
- Keep each commentary focused and concise (2-5 sentences typically)
- Use bullet points, bold text, or other markdown formatting to enhance readability
- Add external links or references if they enhance understanding

**Page Information:**
{% if page_source %}
- Page source to analyze: {{ page_source }}
{% else %}
- Page URL to analyze: {{ page_url }}
{% endif %}
- Page title: {{ page_title }}
{% if page_summary %}
- User-provided summary: {{ page_summary }}
{% endif %}
{% if user_context %}
- AI-generated context: {{ user_context }}
{% endif %}
{% if custom_instructions %}

**Additional Instructions:**
{{ custom_instructions }}
{% endif %}

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure (no markdown code blocks, no extra text):

{
  "notes": [
    {
      "highlighted_text": "Verbatim text from the page (10-200 characters)",
      "commentary": "Markdown-formatted study note explaining this text (not just restatement)",
      "position_hint": "Unique phrase, CSS selector, or heading context to locate this text"
    }
  ]
}

Requirements: Generate 5-15 notes depending on page complexity. Ensure proper JSON formatting with escaped quotes.
