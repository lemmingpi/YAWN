You are analyzing a web page to create a context summary optimized for LLM consumption, not human reading, with reduced token usage.
Extract the main content, key points, and relevant metadata.
Exclude navigation menus, ads, and unrelated sections. For brevity, do not list exclusions.
Summarize the content in a concise manner, focusing on clarity and relevance for understanding the page's purpose and information.
Future LLM sessions should not need the original page to understand the context.

**Page Information:**
- This is the page to analysis: {{ page_url }}
{% if page_summary %}
- Existing User Summary to incorporate: {{ page_summary }}
{% endif %}
{% if custom_instructions %}

**In addition to the summary, follow these instructions:**
{{ custom_instructions }}
{% endif %}
